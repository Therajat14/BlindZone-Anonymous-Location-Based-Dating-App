# BlindZone Roadmap

A clear, sprint-wise plan for building **BlindZone**, an anonymous, location-based dating/chat web app using the MERN stack.

---

## üìã 1. Vision & Objectives

- **Vision:** A simple web app that connects nearby users anonymously via text chat.
- **Objectives:**  
  - Build and launch MVP in 6 weeks.  
  - Implement core features: auth, location discovery, real-time chat.  
  - Use only MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and Socket.io.

## üöÄ 4. Detailed Sprint Plan

### Phase 0: Setup (Week 1)
- Initialize Git repo and GitHub Actions for CI.
- Configure environment files (`.env` for PORT, MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET).
- Scaffold Express server and React app (Vite or Create React App).
- Connect frontend and backend via proxy or CORS.

### Phase 1: Authentication (Weeks 2‚Äì3)
- **Backend:**  
  - User schema (email unique, password hash).  
  - Auth routes: `/signup`, `/login`.  
  - JWT generation and middleware to protect routes.
- **Frontend:**  
  - Signup and login forms with validation.  
  - Store JWT in memory or secure cookie.

### Phase 2: Location Discovery (Week 4)
- Capture user‚Äôs geolocation (HTML5 Geolocation API).
- Save coordinates to user profile.
- Build API endpoint `/discover` that returns nearby users (Mongo geospatial index).
- Frontend: display list or map markers of nearby anonymous users.

### Phase 3: Real-Time Chat (Weeks 5‚Äì6)
- **Backend:**  
  - Integrate Socket.io on the Express server.  
  - Handle user join, message events, and leave.

- **Frontend:**  
  - Connect to Socket.io server.  
  - Chat interface: message list, input box, send button.  
  - Assign random anonymous display name per session.

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing (Week 7)
- Responsive design tweaks for mobile and desktop.
- Add basic unit/integration tests for critical routes.
- Input sanitization and error handling.

### Phase 5: Beta Launch (Week 8)
- Internal beta testing with a small group.
- Fix identified bugs and performance bottlenecks.
- Deploy to production (Heroku/Vercel).  
- Share link for feedback.

## ‚úÖ 5. Next Steps

1. Kick off Phase 0 with repo setup and environment configuration.  
2. Assign tasks and set up daily stand-ups.  
3. Start building core features in Phase 1.
